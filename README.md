MPCLibrary
==========

MPD is a music server application, this library facilitates communication with it.

MPCLibrary is the library component of the <a href="https://github.com/thelollies/MPC">MPC android app</a>. It has no reliance on the app so it is perfectly suitable for a non-android implementation. 

This library is not a typical MPD client implementation. MPD playback usually consists of creating playlists and playing them. This library is designed to be used in a more traditional music player fashion where an artist/album/song is selected and played without prior creation of playlists. Please try the app for a better idea of what this means!
